# Baranda (باراندا) — React Native / Expo
<!-- ↔ سُمّي المشروع "Diarino" سابقًا؛ الاسم اتغيّر لـ"Baranda" لكن معرّفات
     البنية التحتية (Cloudinary preset، Supabase project name، الدومين
     diarino.app، bundle id) سيبناها زي ما هي عشان مفيش حاجة تنكسر —
     شوف ملاحظة lib/cloudinary.ts لو حابين تغيّروها بنفس الاسم لاحقًا. -->

Migrated from the original vanilla-JS single-page app (`app-viewer.html`) to
Expo Router + TypeScript + Supabase + LiveKit.

## 1. Install

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your Supabase project URL + anon key
```

This project uses native modules (LiveKit, react-native-maps, camera) that
**do not work in Expo Go**. You must build a Dev Client:

```bash
npx expo install expo-video   # picture-in-picture reel playback (new)
npx expo prebuild
npx expo run:android   # or: npx expo run:ios
```

## 2. Supabase setup

### Two separate projects

- **dev/preview** — `nlvrmmwujnwifwedhagy` (used by the `development` and
  `preview` profiles in `eas.json`)
- **production** — `nwbtzchtwyhqktoerbap` ("diarino production", used by the
  `production` profile)

Both need every migration in `supabase/migrations/` applied and every Edge
Function deployed — they're two independent databases, so a migration run
against one never reaches the other. The commands below target whichever
project you're currently linked to (`supabase link`), so run this whole
section twice: once per project.

Run every migration in `supabase/migrations/` in order (they're timestamped,
so `supabase db push` applies them correctly as long as none are skipped):

```bash
supabase db push
```

Then deploy the Edge Functions:

```bash
supabase functions deploy livekit-token
supabase functions deploy livekit-recording
supabase functions deploy livekit-moderate
supabase functions deploy livekit-send-message
supabase functions deploy livekit-webhook --no-verify-jwt
supabase functions deploy send-push --no-verify-jwt
```

### Required manual step: push notifications webhook

`send-push` needs a Database Webhook to actually fire (functions aren't
called automatically just by being deployed), **and** a shared secret so
that webhook is the only thing that can call it (RLS audit fix — the
function has no other way to verify a request is legitimate, since it
has to run with `--no-verify-jwt`).

1. `supabase secrets set PUSH_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<a long random string>`
2. Supabase Dashboard → Database → Webhooks → create one: table
   `notifications`, event `Insert`, type `Supabase Edge Function`,
   function `send-push`, then under **HTTP Headers** add
   `x-webhook-secret` = the same value from step 1.

See `supabase/functions/send-push/index.ts`'s header comment for the
full explanation.

### Required manual step: Cloudinary upload preset

Media (property videos/photos, avatars, chat images, live posters) uploads
directly from the device to Cloudinary (`lib/cloudinary.ts`), not Supabase
Storage. In the Cloudinary dashboard, the upload preset named in that file
(`Diarino_uploads`) must be set to **Unsigned** — that's what lets the app
upload without ever holding an API secret client-side. The three storage
buckets below are what older uploads (from before this switch) still point
at; new uploads no longer use them.

### Required secrets (`supabase secrets set KEY=value`)

`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are
auto-provided by Supabase to every deployed Edge Function for whichever
project it's deployed to — **don't** `secrets set` these three, they're
already there. Only the custom ones below need setting manually:

| Secret | Used by |
|---|---|
| `LIVEKIT_URL` | livekit-token, livekit-recording, livekit-moderate, livekit-send-message, livekit-webhook |
| `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` | same five |
| `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` | same five |
| `RECORDING_S3_ACCESS_KEY` | livekit-recording, livekit-webhook |
| `RECORDING_S3_SECRET` | livekit-recording |
| `RECORDING_S3_ENDPOINT` | livekit-recording |
| `RECORDING_S3_BUCKET` | livekit-recording, livekit-webhook |
| `RECORDING_S3_REGION` | livekit-recording (defaults to us-east-1 if unset) |

`RECORDING_S3_*` values come from **Supabase Dashboard → Storage → S3
Connection**, after creating a bucket named `live-recordings` there.

### Required manual step: LiveKit webhook

In the LiveKit Cloud dashboard → Settings → Webhooks, add:
```
https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/livekit-webhook
```

### Required manual step: OAuth redirect

In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs, add:
```
diarino://auth-callback
https://**.app.github.dev/**
```
The wildcard is for temporary GitHub Codespaces web origins. Set the
production **Site URL** to the deployed web app's permanent origin; do not
use a Codespaces URL as the production Site URL. The web client returns to
the current origin and handles OAuth tokens there, including when Supabase
falls back to the root URL.

### Required manual step: enabling guest mode ("المتابعة كضيف")

Every table's RLS `select` policy is scoped `to authenticated` — a "guest"
still needs a real Supabase session for reads to work at all, otherwise
RLS silently returns zero rows and the app looks empty. Guest mode uses
Supabase's **anonymous sign-ins** to give guests a real (anonymous)
session instead. Turn it on in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication →
Sign In / Providers → Anonymous Sign-Ins. Without this enabled,
`supabase.auth.signInAnonymously()` (called from `handleSkip()` in
`app/index.tsx`) returns an error and "المتابعة كضيف" won't work.

### Required manual step: granting yourself admin access

There is no in-app way to become an admin (by design — see the RLS policy
comment in `20260721000000_create_user_roles_table.sql`). After signing up
once, insert a row manually via the Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
insert into public.user_roles (user_id, role) values ('<your-user-uuid>', 'admin');
```

### Android Maps API key

`app.json`'s `android.config.googleMaps.apiKey` has a placeholder —
replace it with a real Google Maps API key **before** building for Android
(`eas build`), or the map in the geo-search screen won't render, and fixing
it after a build ships means bumping `versionCode` and rebuilding, not just
re-uploading.

Only **Maps SDK for Android** needs to be enabled in Google Cloud — the app
has no Places/Directions/Geocoding API calls (address-to-coordinates lookup
in `app/publish/create-listing.tsx` uses `expo-location`'s on-device
geocoder, no Google API or key involved). iOS needs no key at all — the map
components never set `PROVIDER_GOOGLE`, so iOS uses Apple Maps by default.

When restricting the key by SHA-1 fingerprint, you need **two** fingerprints,
not one: the EAS build/upload key (`eas credentials` → Android → production →
Keystore) available before any release, and — only after the first upload —
the actual Play App Signing certificate (Play Console → Release → Setup →
App integrity → App signing key certificate), which is what real users'
installs are signed with and is usually different from the upload key. Add
both to the same Maps API key's Android restriction. Full walkthrough,
including exact commands and the correct app.json-before-eas-build order:
`docs/deployment-guide.md` section ٠.

## 3. Storage buckets

Three buckets are created by migrations (`chat-images`, `property-media`,
`avatars`), all public-read with folder-based ownership RLS
(`<uploader_user_id>/...`). A fourth, `live-recordings`, must be created
**manually** in the dashboard (see the S3 Connection step above) since
Egress writes to it via the S3-compatible API, not through a migration.

## 4. What's real vs. what's still local-only

Everything reads/writes real Supabase tables now: properties, requests,
chats/messages (with Realtime), favorites, profiles, live rooms +
recordings, follows, in-app notifications (DB-triggered, Realtime), the
full admin dashboard (reels/lives/reports/users/features/analytics — all
live queries, no mock dataset or AsyncStorage left), and the Cloudinary
media ledger. Nothing is local-device-only anymore.

**Dark mode is fully implemented across the entire app** — every screen
in `app/` and every component in `components/` supports light, dark, and
"follow system" modes via `lib/hooks/useThemeColors.ts`, wired into
`Appearance.setColorScheme()` so native chrome (React Navigation, iOS
`Alert`) picks it up too. This followed the **Media Theming Rule**: any
video/camera surface and its direct overlays (reel action icons, the
info block's gradient+text, live-stream controls, comment/heart overlays)
stay fixed white-on-dark for guaranteed legibility over unpredictable
media content — everything else (bottom tab bar, sheets, modals, forms,
lists) follows the theme. Two deliberate, documented exceptions:
`components/menu/AdBannerCarousel.tsx` (fixed dark banner, same media
rule) and `components/shared/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (a class component by
necessity — React Error Boundaries can't use hooks — kept
dependency-free so it renders even if the theme system itself crashed).
Full rollout history and the exact rule text are in
`docs/deferred-tasks.md`.

## 5. Push notifications setup

In-app notifications (the bell) were already real; this adds the
OS-level push on top, for when the app is backgrounded or closed.

1. `supabase functions deploy send-push --no-verify-jwt`
2. `supabase secrets set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... SUPABASE_URL=...`
3. `supabase secrets set PUSH_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<a long random string>`
4. Supabase Dashboard → Database → Webhooks → create one:
   Table `notifications`, event `Insert`, type `Supabase Edge Function`,
   function `send-push`, then under **HTTP Headers** add
   `x-webhook-secret` = the same value from step 3. The dashboard wires
   the Authorization header itself — the `x-webhook-secret` one is the
   part you add by hand (RLS audit fix — proves the request actually
   came from this webhook, not just anyone who found the function's URL).

Full detail in `supabase/functions/send-push/index.ts`'s header comment.
The client side (`lib/hooks/usePushNotifications.ts`) registers each
signed-in device's Expo push token automatically — no extra setup there
beyond running the `20260819000000_push_tokens.sql` migration and
building a Dev Client (push tokens don't work in Expo Go either).

## 6. Known deferred items

- Full RTL layout mirroring on language toggle reloads the app
  automatically via `expo-updates` in a Dev Client / production build.
  Plain Expo Go / a dev build with no OTA channel configured can't
  reload programmatically (an Expo/React Native platform constraint, not
  something this app can work around) — `lib/hooks/useLanguage.ts` falls
  back to asking the person to restart manually only in that case.
- Ad edit/pin has a 24h window (`canEditAd`); there's no UI for extending it.
- No automated tests.
- **Reel Picture-in-Picture**: implemented for real — the reel video
  engine was migrated from `expo-av` to `expo-video`
  (`components/reel/ReelVideoPlayer.tsx`), with `allowsPictureInPicture`
  wired to the user's opt-in preference (`lib/hooks/usePiPPreference.ts`)
  and the official `expo-video` config plugin added to `app.json`. This
  requires a Dev Client build (`npx expo run:android` /
  `npx expo run:ios`) — it will not work in Expo Go, and needs real
  device testing on both platforms before shipping (not something that
  could be verified without physical devices). `expo-av` is still used
  elsewhere in the app (background music, admin reel preview, live
  replay, mic permissions) — see `docs/deferred-tasks.md` §2 for the
  full list and a known coexistence caveat to watch for.
- **Reel captions**: UI, preference storage, and `captions_ar`/`captions_en`
  DB columns exist and render real data when present, but there's no
  speech-to-text/translation pipeline populating them yet. See
  `docs/deferred-tasks.md` §3 for a concrete Whisper + Translation API
  integration guide.

## 6.1 Live streaming is hidden by default (feature flag)

LiveKit / live-streaming code is kept intact but **hidden from users** until
an admin turns it on. Gate = `feature_flags.key = 'live'`
(`useFeatureFlag("live")`, fail-closed default `false` in
`lib/hooks/useFeatureFlags.ts`). Applied migration:
`20260929000000_hide_live_feature_by_default.sql`. When off, the app hides:
the "اطلع اللايف" menu card (any menu item routing to `/live/*`) and the
"يبث مباشرة الآن" banner (`app/(tabs)/menu.tsx`), the "لايفات" tab
(`app/(tabs)/account.tsx`), the "بثوث مباشرة" section
(`app/seller/[id].tsx`), and blocks the `/live/*` routes themselves
(`app/live/_layout.tsx`; admins can still open replays for review).
To re-enable: Admin panel → "الميزات العامة للمنصة" → toggle "البث المباشر".

## 6.2 Menu page + floating tab bar (reference design)

* **Menu page** (`app/(tabs)/menu.tsx`, cards in `components/menu/MenuCard.tsx`) is still
  driven by `public.menu_items`; row shapes come from `sort_order` + `size`
  (`half+half+tall`, `tall+half+half`, `half+round`, …). Migration
  `20260929010000_menu_reference_layout.sql` re-seeds the cards to the reference
  layout and adds `color_end` (gradient) + `badge_label` columns (both editable in
  the admin "أيقونات القائمة" tab). The client falls back to the old columns if the
  migration is not applied yet.
* **Illustrations** live in `assets/menu-icons/ref_*.png` (extracted from the
  reference image / supplied art, transparent PNGs). To use higher-resolution art, replace a file
  with the same name and update its aspect ratio in `lib/menuIconRegistry.tsx`.
* **"إدارة الحساب"** (`icon_key = account_circle`, `size = round`) renders the signed-in
  user's `profiles.avatar_url` (hook `useMyAvatar`), or a person glyph when none.
* **Floating tab bar** (`app/(tabs)/_floating-tab-bar.tsx`): dark pill (home / menu /
  requests) + a separate round search button, absolutely positioned above the
  system navigation area (`insets.bottom + 14`), shared by every main tab.

## 6.3 Reels navigation speed

`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, `components/reel/ReelCard.tsx`, `ReelVideoPlayer.tsx`,
`lib/reelPrefetch.ts`:

* Card callbacks are now referentially stable (values read through refs), so
  `React.memo(ReelCard)` works: a swipe re-renders only the 2–3 cards whose
  `isActive`/`isNearActive` changed instead of every mounted card.
* Video players are prepared for the active reel −`PRELOAD_BEHIND` (1) and
  +`PRELOAD_AHEAD` (2). Lower `PRELOAD_AHEAD` to 1 in `index.tsx` if low-end
  Android devices show memory/decoder pressure.
* A light poster (`cldReelPoster`, w_720) covers the video until it really starts
  playing (`playingChange`), so there is no black flash; posters of the next reels
  are prefetched into the expo-image cache.
* FlatList window: `windowSize 5`, `initialNumToRender 2`, active item switches at
  50% visibility.

## 6.4 Launch screen (video splash)

* **Native splash** (Android `res/values/colors.xml` + transparent `splashscreen_logo.png`,
  iOS `SplashScreenBackground.colorset` + transparent `SplashScreenLogo.imageset`) is now a
  plain `#7E9967` screen with no logo. `app.json` mirrors this for any future `expo prebuild`.
  Because `android/` and `ios/` are committed, **EAS does not run prebuild — native changes
  only ship in a new native build** (APK/IPA), not via OTA update.
* **Launch video** `assets/splash/baranda_splash.mp4` (1080×1920, 3 s, H.264, muted, faststart)
  plays once per cold start as an overlay from `app/_layout.tsx` →
  `components/launch/LaunchVideoSplash.tsx`. It uses `contentFit="contain"` on the same green,
  so the logo is never cropped on any aspect ratio. If the video can't start within 2.5 s (or
  errors / exceeds 6 s) the overlay is dismissed so launch can never hang.
* To replace the video, overwrite the mp4 (keep a `#7E9967` background) — no code change.

## 6.5 Video compression before upload (Android) + progress

* `lib/videoCompress.ts` — `react-native-compressor`, **Android only**: 720p (longest side
  1280), target bitrate = min(3 Mbps, 80 % of the source bitrate). It decides from the picker
  metadata (size/duration/dimensions) and skips videos that are already light, so it never makes
  a file bigger. iOS compresses in the picker (`videoExportPreset`), web uploads as-is. If the
  library isn't installed or compression fails, the original file is uploaded (never blocks).
* `lib/cloudinary.ts` — `uploadToCloudinary(uri, type, onProgress?)`: real upload progress via
  XHR when `onProgress` is passed (other callers still use `fetch`).
* `components/publish/UploadProgressModal.tsx` — blocking progress sheet (compress → upload →
  publish) shown from `app/publish/create-listing.tsx`; `lib/keepAwake.ts` keeps the screen on.
* **Install & build:** `npm install` (adds `react-native-compressor` and `expo-keep-awake` to
  `package.json` — commit the updated `package-lock.json`, EAS uses `npm ci`), then make a **new
  native build** (APK/IPA). Both are autolinked; no config plugin and no native-file edits.

## 7. Deliberate security decisions

- **`profiles.phone`/`bio`/full-row reads are now real RLS, not just
  UI-gated** (as of `20260825000000_profile_privacy_rls.sql`). The
  `profiles are readable by authenticated users` (`using (true)`) policy
  this section used to describe is gone — replaced with: self, or
  `is_public = true`, or an existing chat partner, or staff
  (`public.is_admin()`). Everything that only ever needed a display
  name/avatar for general browsing (property cards, live-host chips,
  notification actors, follower lists) reads the new `profiles_public`
  view instead (`id, full_name, avatar_url, verified, is_public` + the
  four contact-visibility preference booleans — no phone, no bio). The
  view is owned by the migration role, so it reads the underlying table
  with the owner's privileges and is unconditionally visible regardless
  of `is_public` — that's intentional and safe *because* its column list
  hard-excludes anything sensitive, not because of who's asking.
  `app/property/[id].tsx`'s WhatsApp/call buttons are the one place that
  still needs a real phone number; that screen has its own dedicated
  `usePropertyDetail()` query (`lib/hooks/useProperties.ts`) embedding
  the real `profiles` table, so for a private seller with no open chat
  with the viewer, phone/bio correctly come back null and those buttons
  don't render (see `!!property.seller.phone` guard there) instead of
  silently exposing them the way the old `using (true)` policy did.
- **Live comments/likes are relayed server-side, not published directly**
  (as of `20260826000000_live_message_rate_limit.sql` +
  `livekit-send-message`). `canPublishData` is now `false` for every
  participant, host included (`livekit-token/index.ts`) — a client can no
  longer reach the LiveKit data channel at all. Instead
  `lib/hooks/useLiveKitRoom.ts`'s `sendComment`/`sendLike` call the
  `livekit-send-message` Edge Function, which atomically checks a
  per-user-per-room-per-second counter in Postgres
  (`bump_live_message_rate()`) — 3 comments/sec, 5 likes/sec, same
  numbers as the earlier client-side-only throttle — and only relays the
  message via LiveKit's `RoomServiceClient.sendData()` if the caller is
  still under the cap; over the cap, it's dropped silently (no ban, no
  error surfaced to the sender). This closes the gap the original
  LiveKit security audit flagged (م2): the old client-side throttle
  protected a well-behaved client from itself, but a modified client
  could just skip it and publish straight onto the data channel, since
  every token granted `canPublishData: true`. Now there's no such path
  left to skip. One consequence worth knowing: `RoomServiceClient.sendData()`
  has no per-participant identity attached on the receiving end (a
  documented LiveKit behavior — see livekit/node-sdks#586), so sender
  name/id now travels inside the JSON payload itself instead of coming
  from the `DataReceived` event's `participant` argument, and each
  client filters out its own echoed-back message by matching `senderId`
  against its own `auth.uid()` (the sender already saw it instantly via
  local optimistic UI, so the server-relayed copy reaching them back
  would otherwise double it up). Housekeeping: `live_message_rate_buckets`
  is pruned hourly via a `pg_cron` job (`cleanup-rate-buckets`, see
  `20260831000000_schedule_rate_bucket_cleanup.sql`) rather than growing
  unbounded — safe by construction, since the cleanup only ever touches
  buckets older than an hour while rate checks only ever read/write the
  current second's bucket, so there's no overlap between what's being
  pruned and what's actively being checked.
- **Going live is restricted to non-anonymous accounts**
  (`20260825000000_profile_privacy_rls.sql`'s `lives` INSERT policy adds
  `coalesce((auth.jwt() ->> 'is_anonymous')::boolean, false) = false`).
  Supabase anonymous ("guest") sessions can browse, chat, and watch live
  broadcasts, but can't publish listings or requests (`20261007000000_block_guest_publish.sql`;
  UI: `lib/guestGate.ts` + `app/publish/_layout.tsx`) and can't start a live broadcast — broadcasting
  video of yourself is a real moderation/legal liability, and an
  anonymous account isn't traceable the way a Google-authenticated one
  is. `app/(tabs)/menu.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/account.tsx`, and
  `app/live/broadcast.tsx` all show a clear "sign in with Google to go
  live" message client-side before a guest ever reaches a camera/mic
  permission prompt, but the actual, unbypassable enforcement is this
  RLS policy — it's what makes the client-side checks a UX nicety rather
  than the real security boundary. Note this is the one place in the app
  where guest and Google-authenticated sessions are treated differently;
  everywhere else (chat, publishing, browsing) both work identically.
- **Admin audit log coverage** (`admin_audit_log`, triggers across
  `20260810000000_admin_audit_and_permission_enforcement.sql` and
  `20260828000000_admin_audit_coverage_extension.sql`): every admin
  write to properties/lives moderation, ad banners, sponsored reels,
  menu items, feature flags, ad-carousel settings, and
  suggestion/support-message dismissal is logged with who/when/before/
  after — readable at `components/admin/AdminAuditLog.tsx`. Deliberately
  NOT logged: a user's own inserts into `suggestions`/`support_messages`
  (that's normal user activity, tracked instead in
  `user_activity_log`/`useAuditLogs.ts`, not an *admin* action) and reads
  of any admin screen (only writes are audited — read access is already
  fully gated by `admin_has_permission()`, so there's no write to log).
